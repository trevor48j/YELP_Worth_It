# YELP_Worth_It

## Overview
 
Our group aims to extract key information, such as ratings, price ranges, and more from Yelp by web scraping using Pandas and Python in a Jupyter Notebook to extract data to better understand performance, customer engagement. We plan on uncovering how the information gathered may correlate by first transforming the data by cleaning, splitting, and finally loading our extracted and readied lists into a database within MongoDB.

# Purpose

1. Gain insight to customer feedback - Businesses can get insight into great, good, and bad experiences to attract new customers positively influence customer retention
2. Understand product value - Details about how customers will spend their money for certain products/offerings, proclivities to newly introduced items, or trends among competitors
3. Make knowledgeable and market aware decisions - Knowing market saturation in a particular area can help posture a business to create value for its intended audience. This will enable the ability to create unique value opportunities and establish a name for an underrepresented niche
